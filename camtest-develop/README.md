# CamTest
## Overview
CamTest is a command line application for exercising the Sentera Protocol ICD for camera control.
The application supports both Windows and Linux operating systems and the following cameras:
* Torpedo base single, double, and quadruple
* QX-10 HW1
* QX-10 HW2
* SnapCam

## Compiling and Executing the Application
### Connect
Connect the camera directly to a UNIX or Windows PC via ethernet or ensure both devices are active and 
operating on the same network.  In order to send and recieve imaging/status packets from the sensor,
the PC must be assigned a specific IP address based on the camera's platform.

Platform	|	Camera IPv4			|	PC IPv4
:---:		|	---					|	---
Phoenix 2	|	192.168.143.141		|	192.168.143.10
Omni		|	192.168.143.141		|	192.168.143.10
Indago		|	192.168.168.141		|	192.168.168.10
Double4k	|	192.168.168.141		|	192.168.168.130

On Windows systems, a static IP address is assigned to the Wi-Fi network interface via the Network 
Connections pane of the Control Panel.  The Network Connections pane can be accessed by searching "View 
network connections" in the Start menu, opening "ncpa.cpl" via a Run instance, or opening Control Panel 
and navigating Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center > Change adapter Settings.  From the 
Network Connections pane, right-click the Wi-Fi interface and click Properties.  Double-click 
the entry labelled Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4). In the new properties window, select the 
radio button labelled "Use the following IP address." For *IP address* enter the address corresponding
to the relevant system shown above and for *Subnet mask* enter "255.255.255.0" as shown the the following 
screen capture.  Click Ok to save the network settings.

On UNIX systems, setting a static IP address varies across distributions. Please refer to the distrubution
documentation or webpage for assistance.

### Compile
#### Windows
On Windows systems, compiling a C++ program requires additional software.  Refer to the following
link for instructions on using the command-line compiler packaged with Microsoft's free IDE, Visual
Studio Community Edition: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235639.aspx.

In short:

1. Install Visual Studio Community  
2. Open the Windows search bar and type "command".  Select "VS2015 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt".  
   Doing so opens a command prompt with environment variables set to enable command line compiling.  
3. `> cd` to the camtest source directory.  
4. `> nmake -f makefile.windows`  

You can also provide the following arguments to `nmake`: `all`, `clean`, and `camtest`.

#### Unix
On UNIX systems, simply open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the CamTest project
files and issue the following command.

'gpp -o main CameraTest.cpp crc.c''

Upon success, the command produces the executable *main*.
	
### Execute
Following compilation, the application is intialized using the following template.

`[CamTest Executable] [Camera IPv4] [Port] [PC IPv4] [# of Cameras]`

where [CamTest Executable] is the filepath of the compiled executable, [Camera IPv4] is the IP address 
of the camera (see *Connecting* above), [Port] is the specific port the camera utilizes to send packets 
(default is 60530), [PC IPv4] is the static IP address of the PC (see *Connecting* above), and 
[# of Cameras] is the discrete number of connected cameras/sensors.

For example, the following command might initalize CamTest for a dual-sensor camera from an Omni systm
on a Windows PC:

`CamTest.exe 192.168.143.141 60530 192.168.143.10 2`

## Operating the Application
### Status
Upon initalizing the application, CamTest provides a realtime display of the imager statuses in the following format:

`Sentera # [S-001   0% /  0 GB]`

where the number following *Sentera* represents the imager ID, the S (or R) represents session stopped (or running), The number next to the S (or R)
represents the current image count, the percentage represents the portion of card memory consumed, and the number preceding GB represents card memory size.

In the case of a communication error, the following status will be displayed:

`Sentera # [No Communication]`

To resolve the issue, check the connection and restart the application.
